## Critical Gaps for Large Organizations

### 1. Contract & Vendor Management
No workflows for contract review, vendor evaluation, renewal tracking, or procurement approvals. Legal and procurement teams lack AI-assisted triage.

### 2. Finance & Budget Operations
RevOps covers sales pipeline but misses budget variance analysis, expense categorization, forecast narratives, and audit preparation. Finance teams underserved.

### 3. HR & People Operations
Only individual onboarding exists. Missing: headcount planning, job architecture design, performance calibration scaffolds, organizational change communication.

### 4. IT & Infrastructure Operations
No incident postmortem builders, change request briefings, infrastructure planning tools, or automation opportunity identification for IT teams.

### 5. Governance & Risk
No steering committee pack generators, OKR review digests, policy framework builders, or enterprise risk assessment tools. Board-level and compliance officer needs unmet.

### 6. Cross-Functional Coordination
No workflows connecting finance, HR, and operations data. Missing: integrated planning packs, cross-departmental status briefings, M&A due diligence support.

## Opportunity Assessment

**Highest leverage areas for time/cost savings:**

1. **Contract triage and approvals** — Days of legal review reduced to hours
2. **Budget variance explanations** — Manual analysis automated for finance teams
3. **Headcount planning documentation** — HR planning cycles accelerated
4. **Incident postmortems** — IT operations documentation standardized
5. **Steering committee packs** — Executive reporting streamlined across functions

These gaps represent significant manual labor in enterprises today, with high error rates and cycle-time waste.

## Post Content

**I'm giving away 124 production-ready AI prompts. No strings attached.**

After months of building SkillEngine, I realized the most valuable thing we created wasn't the app—it was the prompts.

So I'm open-sourcing all of them. Today.

**Why am I doing this?**

Because AI is only as good as the prompts you feed it.

Most people are underutilizing these tools. Not because they're not smart—because crafting great prompts is a skill that takes time to develop.

These prompts represent hundreds of hours of iteration. Use them. Modify them. Build on them.

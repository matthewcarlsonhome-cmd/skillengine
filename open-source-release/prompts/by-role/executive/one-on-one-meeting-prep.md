SECTION 1: 1:1 MEETING PHILOSOPHY
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**Core Principles**:
1. **Their Meeting, Not Yours**: The 1:1 belongs to the direct report first
2. **Relationship Over Tasks**: Status updates can happen async; 1:1s build trust
3. **Coaching Over Directing**: Ask questions before giving answers
4. **Consistency Matters**: Regular cadence builds psychological safety
5. **Document & Follow Through**: Action items without follow-up erode trust

**Meeting Cadence Best Practices**:
- Weekly for new employees or those needing support
- Bi-weekly for tenured, high-performing team members
- Never cancel; reschedule if needed

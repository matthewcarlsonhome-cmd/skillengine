**COMMUNICATION PHILOSOPHY:**
1. **BLUF (Bottom Line Up Front)**: Executives decide in seconds; lead with what matters most
2. **Pyramid Principle**: Main point → Supporting arguments → Evidence (never bury the lead)
3. **Audience Calibration**: Board needs strategic framing; teams need tactical clarity
4. **The Ask Must Be Clear**: Every communication must answer "What do you need from me?"
5. **Anticipate Resistance**: Address objections before they're raised
6. **Simplicity is Sophistication**: Complex ideas expressed simply show mastery
7. **Evidence Over Assertion**: Claims without data are opinions; opinions are ignored

**MESSAGE ARCHITECTURE FRAMEWORK:**
| Component | Purpose | Word Count | Example |
|-----------|---------|------------|---------|
| Headline | Capture attention | 5-10 words | "Q3 revenue exceeded plan by 12%" |
| Opening | State the bottom line | 1-2 sentences | What happened, what it means |
| Body | Support with evidence | 3-5 points | Facts, data, implications |
| Ask | Specify action needed | 1-2 sentences | Decision, approval, resource |
| Close | Reinforce key point | 1 sentence | Return to headline |

**EXECUTIVE ATTENTION SPANS:**
| Stakeholder | Available Time | Content Limit | Preferred Format |
|-------------|---------------|---------------|------------------|
| Board Members | 60 seconds per topic | 1 page max | Visual dashboard |
| CEO/CFO | 2-3 minutes | 2 pages | BLUF + data table |
| VPs/Directors | 5-10 minutes | 3-5 pages | Narrative + appendix |
| External (Media) | 30 seconds | Sound bites | Quotable statements |

| Purpose | Lead With | Tone | Key Element |
|---------|-----------|------|-------------|

| **Decision Request** | The decision needed | Urgent clarity | Options, recommendation |
| **Risk Escalation** | The risk and impact | Serious, controlled | Mitigation plan |
| **Achievement** | The win and credit | Celebratory, humble | Business impact |
| **Change Comm** | The why first | Empathetic, direct | What's changing, support |
| **Budget Request** | The ROI | Business case | Investment vs. return |

**AUDIENCE CALIBRATION:**

| Audience | Attention Span | Detail Level | Decision Authority |
|----------|----------------|--------------|-------------------|
| Board | 60 seconds | Strategic only | Approve/reject |
| C-Suite | 2 minutes | Key metrics | Direct action |

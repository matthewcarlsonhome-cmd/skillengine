SECTION 1: RETROSPECTIVE PHILOSOPHY
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**Prime Directive** (Norm Kerth):
"Regardless of what we discover, we understand and truly believe that everyone did the best job they could, given what they knew at the time, their skills and abilities, the resources available, and the situation at hand."

**Core Principles**:
1. **Psychological Safety First**: People must feel safe to speak honestly
2. **Focus on Systems, Not People**: Blame the process, not individuals
3. **Action Over Discussion**: Every retro must produce concrete improvements
4. **Celebrate Wins**: Recognition fuels engagement
5. **Follow Through**: Unaddressed actions erode trust in the process

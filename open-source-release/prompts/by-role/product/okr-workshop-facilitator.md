**OKR PHILOSOPHY - THE 7 PRINCIPLES:**
1. **Ambitious**: Objectives should inspire stretch, not guarantee
2. **Measurable**: Key Results must be quantifiable
3. **Time-Bound**: Clear deadlines create accountability
4. **Aligned**: Connect individual work to company mission

7. **Iterative**: Learn and adjust each cycle

**OKR QUALITY BENCHMARKS:**
| Element | Poor | Good | Excellent |
|---------|------|------|-----------|
| Objective | Vague, task-like | Clear direction | Inspiring and memorable |
| Key Result | Activity-based | Measurable outcome | Leading indicator + baseline |
| Alignment | No connection | Loosely connected | Clear cascade with autonomy |
| Ambition | Sandbagged (100% achievable) | Stretched | 70% confidence of achievement |

SECTION 2: OKR METHODOLOGY
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**PHASE 1: OBJECTIVE SETTING**

**Objective Quality Criteria:**
| Criterion | Test Question | Example Pass | Example Fail |
|-----------|---------------|--------------|--------------|
| Qualitative | Is it a goal, not a metric? | "Delight enterprise customers" | "Achieve 50 NPS" |
| Inspirational | Would you be proud to achieve it? | "Become the category leader" | "Maintain market share" |
| Actionable | Can the team influence it? | "Transform onboarding" | "Grow the economy" |
| Time-bound | Clear when it's achieved? | "Launch by Q2" | "Eventually launch" |

**Objective Formulation Framework:**
[Verb] + [What] + [Why it matters]

Examples:
- "Transform customer onboarding to enable faster time-to-value"
- "Build a world-class engineering culture that attracts top talent"
- "Establish market leadership in the enterprise segment"

**PHASE 2: KEY RESULT DEFINITION**

**Key Result Formula:**
[Metric] from [X baseline] to [Y target]

**Key Result Quality Tests:**
| Test | Question | Good KR | Bad KR |
|------|----------|---------|--------|
| Specific | Is there one interpretation? | "NPS from 32 to 50" | "Improve satisfaction" |
| Measurable | Can we track it? | "Response time <200ms" | "Faster performance" |
| Achievable | Is 70% confidence realistic? | "Revenue +20%" | "Revenue +500%" |
| Relevant | Does it prove the objective? | "Churn 5%→3%" | "Blog posts published" |
| Time-bound | When do we measure? | "By end of Q2" | "Eventually" |

**Key Result Types:**
| Type | When to Use | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| Metric | Quantifiable outcome | "NPS from 32 to 50" |
| Milestone | Binary achievement | "Launch V2.0 to production" |
| Baseline | Establishing measurement | "Establish baseline for X" |

**PHASE 3: ALIGNMENT CHECK**

**Vertical Alignment:**
Company OKRs → Department OKRs → Team OKRs → Individual OKRs

**Alignment Questions:**
- Does this support a higher-level objective?
- Could we achieve the higher objective if everyone hits these?
- Is there clear line-of-sight to company mission?

**Horizontal Alignment:**
- What cross-functional dependencies exist?
- Which teams need to be coordinated?
- Where are potential conflicts?

**PHASE 4: SCORING & GRADING**

**Standard Scoring Scale:**
| Score | Meaning | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| 0.0-0.3 | Failed | Significant miss |
| 0.4-0.6 | Made Progress | Partial achievement |
| 0.7-1.0 | Achieved | Goal met or exceeded |

**Interpreting Scores:**
- Consistent 1.0s = Not ambitious enough (sandbagging)
- Consistent 0.3s = Too aggressive or poor execution
- Average 0.6-0.7 = Healthy stretch

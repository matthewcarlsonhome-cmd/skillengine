        "mainObjections": "The client's concerns include: 1) Will their data be used to train your AI models? 2) How do you comply with banking regulations (OCC guidance on AI)? 3) What happens during an AI system failure? 4) How do you ensure AI outputs are accurate for financial decisions? 5) Their board is asking about AI risk management. 6) Concerns about vendor lock-in with AI features.",
        "yourAICapabilities": "Our platform uses AI for: document analysis and extraction (contract review, statement parsing), intelligent search across their document repository, automated report generation with natural language summaries, anomaly detection in transaction data, predictive analytics for customer behavior. We use GPT-4 via Azure OpenAI and custom-trained models.",
        "dataHandlingPractices": "Customer data is processed in their dedicated Azure tenant. Data is encrypted at rest (AES-256) and in transit (TLS 1.3). We do NOT use customer data for model training - only for inference. Azure OpenAI does not retain prompts or outputs. Our custom models are trained only on synthetic and licensed data. We maintain complete audit logs of all AI operations.",
